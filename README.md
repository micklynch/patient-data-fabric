_Please refer to the [Patient Data Network](https://github.com/micklynch/patient-data-network) before looking here!_

This was created as a placeholder for a full (re-)implementation of The Patient Data Network. It was started due to the [notice from IBM](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/composer/message/125) that development on Hyperledger Composer will slow over the coming months.

The implementation follows the [Chaincode for Developers](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/chaincode4ade.html) tutorial on the official Hyperledger wiki.
